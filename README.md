## Design

### Colour Scheme

![HeartCare Hub colour palete](assets/images/HeartCareHubcolourpalette.png)

These set of colours were chosen to provide association with the representative colours of the heart.

### Typography

Research was completed on the preferred typography on a healthcare website. As HeartCare Hub can be referred to as a healthcare website, using similar typography will respect the convention and encourage consistency.

These three fonts were recommended for the use of healthcare websites: [1]

* Source Sans pro- sans-serif font
* Crimsons text- serif font
* Fjord One - sans-serif font

The applied use of a combination serif and sans-serif is further recommended in a medical website to provide contrast.

Therefore, these three recommended fonts will be used along with different font-weights used accodingly.

These fonts will be taken from Google Fonts and to be used within my Cascading Style Sheets(CSS).

### Imagery

Images will be taken from free online sources and will be referenced accordinly. Many of these images will be healthcare related.

### Wireframes
